Running Lussac
==============

Once installed, you can run lussac using a :code:`params.json` file as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

	lussac params.json

The :code:`params.json` file contains all the parameters for Lussac, so that it cas read your date and know what you want to do with them (e.g. run spike-sorting algorithms, apply custom post-processing, merge multiple outputs ...).
The specifics of the :code:`params.json` file are described in the next section.

Note that some parameters file are provided for a quickstart, but you will need to modify the :code:`"recording"` part so that it fits your data (explained in the next section).
