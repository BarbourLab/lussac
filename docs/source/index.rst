Welcome to Lussac documentation!
==================================

Lussac is a Python package to automate analysis of multielectrode extracellular recordings.

The goal is to improve the **yield** and **quality** of data from multielectrode extracellular recordings by **comparing** the outputs of different spike-sorting algorithms and/or multiple analysis runs with different parameters.
